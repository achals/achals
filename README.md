### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m Achal, a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/). I lead our prediction logging and feature engineering efforts. Previously, I was at [Tecton](https://www.tecton.ai/), which was acquired by Databricks. There, I was leading a bunch of their streaming and realtime efforts. I blog at blog.achals.com
